# [A LANDSLIDE HAS OCCURRED](http://le717.github.io/landslides) #

In the 1999 Real-Time-Strategy PC video game [LEGO&reg; Rock Raiders](http://www.rockraidersunited.org/wiki/index.php?title=LEGO_Rock_Raiders_%28PC_video_game%29), whenever a landslide occurs an audio clip for [Chief](http://www.rockraidersunited.org/wiki/index.php?title=Chief) will play, exclaiming "A LANDSLIDE HAS OCCURRED". On modern computers, landslides have created a well known glitch where Chief will practically scream this phrase in an endless loop until the game is closed or crashes from some other glitch. **A LANDSLIDE HAS OCCURRED** recreates this annoying yet occasionally funny glitch, all while paying tribute to the seemingly endless amount of sandwiches Rock Raiders almost constantly want to eat.
